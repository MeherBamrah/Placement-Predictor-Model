# Placement Predictor Model 🎓

A machine learning project to predict student placement outcomes based on academic and personal attributes.  
_Developed as part of the GDG Build with AI Bootcamp._

---

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains the code, data, and analysis for predicting campus placement chances using various machine learning models. The project aims to assist students and institutions in understanding the key factors influencing placement success.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares raw placement data for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizes trends and uncovers insights in the dataset.
- **Model Building**: Implements and compares classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assesses models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Interpretability**: Highlights the most important features affecting placement outcomes.
